Throwing this here for anyone with Windows having trouble installing tensorflow:

set PYTHONPATH=C:\Users\micha\OneDrive\Documents\Github\models\research;C:\Users\micha\OneDrive\Documents\Github\models\research\slim

^^^ That command saved the day after hours of trial and error

(Obviously pathname needs to be reconfigured for your pc)
